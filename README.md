# Robinhood Python API (UNOFFICIAL)

#This was like a schizo paranoid dream I had back in the day where I wanted a trading bot and it wanted the api to come back because robinhood changed the auth so we fixed it and this is the old code..

WARNING!!

Robinhood is now requiring a mandatory MFA.

Going to your Robinhood Web App and turning on 2FA is highly recommended because without it your auth tokens will expire every 24 hours.
To do this, go to settings, turn on 2FA, select "Authentication App", click "Can't Scan It?", and save the 16-character QR code.

For now, only Python 3 code will work with this.

Use something like this to login:

    QR = "1234567890qwerty"
    my_trader = Robinhood()
    my_trader.login(username="username", password="password", qr_code=QR)

Without 2FA this API can be run from the console where the user will have to input an SMS code sent to their phone when you run the login function.
After logging in the SMS code expires after 24 hours.
In theory, one could trade with an algorithm if they signed in with the console at the beginning of each trading day.

If this is your case, use this to login and then enter your SMS code to the console:

    my_trader = Robinhood()
    my_trader.login(username="username", password="password")
